Please read the following before starting the exam.

\begin{itemize}

    \item You may consult three double-sided sheets of notes (or six single-sided sheets).

    \item You may not consult other notes, textbooks, \&c. Calculators,
        computers and other electronic devices are not permitted without prior
        accomodation.

        told to look there.

    \item Before you turn in your exam, write your Student ID at the
        top of every page.

    \item Bubble every item completely! Avoid using checkmarks, Xs, writing
        answers on the side, \&c. If you want to unselect an option, erase it
        completely and clearly.

    \item For questions with circular bubbles, you may select only one choice.

        \subitem \coloredbubble[none]{} Unselected option (completely unfilled)

        \subitem \coloredbubble[black]{} Only one selected option (completely filled)

        \subitem \coloredselect[black]{} You can select

        \subitem \coloredselect[black]{} multiple squares (completely filled).

    \item We reserve the right to deduct points from exams which do not follow
        the above directions. (Of course, we will make reasonable exceptions.)

    \item You have 170 minutes. There are \numquestions\ questions, of varying
